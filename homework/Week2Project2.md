# Week 2 Project 2 - Writing Functions

This homework assignment is designed to see if you can write and use functions in different parts of javascript.

### Instructions

First, get the [project javascript file](https://github.com/riotcku/learntocode/blob/master/homework/js/week2project2.js) into your VSCode environment. This time, this js file is incomplete - it is up to you to complete it!

The file itself has functions that currently are empty but has comment blocks that instruct you on exactly what to write.

Complete the assignment as directed in `week2project2.js`. This means writing the 3 functions as directed and tying it together in the `if` statement at the end.

As this assignment is more difficult, you may work with whoever else in the class you want. I will be available, just reach out on discord with any questions and I'll guide you in the right direction.

### Turning it in

Rename the file similar to the first project: `{first name or discord name}-project2.js` So mine might be called `chris-project2.js` or `ink-project2.js`.

Turn this assignment in via email (my email will be written in our discord `#homework` channel) discord or facebook.

Best of luck!
